Bootswatch
==========

Bootswatch is a collection of free themes for your [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) site. Check it out at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com).

How do I use Bootswatch?
-----
Head over to [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) and download the `bootswatch.min.css` file associated with a swatch.

In Bootstrap’s CSS directory, you’ll find a stylesheet in full (`bootstrap.css`) and minified (`bootstrap.min.css`) forms. Rename them or move them to a safe place. Then drop in the new CSS file and check that your HTML points to it. If you ever change your mind, simply drop in another swatch or switch back to the original.

How do I extend Bootswatch?
------
Bootswatch is an open source project, and you’re welcome to modify the swatches further or create your own. If you’re interested, fork or follow the GitHub repository. The files of interest are in the `gh-pages` branch.

Each raw swatch consists of two LESS files. One is `variables.less`, which is included by default in Bootstrap and allows you to customize [these settings](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/less.html#variables). The other is a new file called `bootswatch.less` that introduces more extensive structural changes.

Check out the README in the `swatchmaker` directory for step-by-step instructions for building your own swatches.

How do I plug into Bootswatch?
-----

A simple API is available for integrating your site or app with Bootswatch.

The swatches are housed in an array called `themes`, and each swatch has the following properties:  `name`, `description`, `preview`, `thumbnail`, `css`, `css-min`, `less`, and `less-variables`.

CORS and JSONP are supported. Send your request to `http://simplejsonp.nodester.com/bootswatch/`
