					<h3><u>FAQ</u></h3><br />
						<ul>
						<li>
						<h4>Lost Password:</h4>
						To recover your <u>GCconnex Password</u>, go to the <a href='http://gcconnex.gc.ca/'>GCconnex main page</a> or access the <u>Log in</u> pop-up found in the upper left corner of every GCconnex page. Follow the <u>Lost password</u> link and enter your username or email address, then click <u>Request</u>. A link to reset your password will be sent to email address you associated with your GCconnex account. Follow this link, and then click <u>Reset password</u> to have a new, randomly generated password emailed to your email address. 
						<br /><br />
						Once you have logged in with the new password, follow the <u>Settings</u> link found in the upper right corner of every GCconnex page. Under the <u>Account password</u> heading, enter your <u>Current password</u> (the randomly generated password which has been emailed to you) and <u>Your new password</u> (the password you would like to use going forward) twice, then click <u>Save</u>.
						</li> <br />

						<li>
						<h4>Lost Username:</h4>
						If you have forgotten your <u>GCconnex Username</u>, don't worry; it is not necessary to recover it. You can use your GCconnex-associated email address to login to GCconnex, either on the <a href='http://gcconnex.gc.ca/'>GCconnex main page</a> or the Log in pop-up found in the upper left hand corner of every GCconnex page. 
						<br /><br />
						However, if your email has changed since you signed up for GCconnex, you cannot use the new one to login unless you have <a href='http://gcconnex.gc.ca/settings/'>updated your email in your settings</a>. Please email <a href='mailto:gcconnex@tbs-sct.gc.ca'>gcconnex@tbs-sct.gc.ca</a> and note that you no longer have access to your GCconnex- associated email address. We will get back to you within two business days.
