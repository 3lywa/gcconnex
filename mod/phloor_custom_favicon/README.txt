/**
 * Description
 */
Enables a custom favicon for your Elgg site. 
You are able to upload an image which will be scaled down to 16x16 and used as favicon.
Allowed mimetypes are 'image/gif', 'image/jpg', 'image/jpeg', 
'image/pjpeg' and 'image/png'.

Installation steps:
1. Download 'Phloor Custom Favicon' plugin.
2. Extract the archive file into the plugin directory of your 
   Elgg installation.
3. Enable the plugin from the admin view.
4. Upload your own favicon in the admin interface (Apperance -> Favicon). 
5. Wait till the icon gets reflected. You should see it in the tab next to 
   the title.  Try clearing cache (disable caching, run upgrade.php, 
   enable chaching).
